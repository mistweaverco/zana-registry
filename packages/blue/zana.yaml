  blue is a somewhat less uncompromising code formatter than black, the OG of
  Python formatters. We love the idea of

  automatically formatting Python code, for the same reasons that inspired
  black, however we take issue with some of the

  decisions black makes. Kudos to black for pioneering code formatting for
  Python, and for its excellent implementation.
